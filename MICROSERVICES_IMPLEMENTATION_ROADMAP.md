# 🚀 SEOAgent Microservices Implementation Roadmap

This document provides the complete implementation plan for transforming the SEOAgent monolith into a microservices architecture that enables parallel development with multiple Claude Code instances.

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (COMPLETED)

### 🎯 **Completed Deliverables**

1. **📋 API Audit** (`MICROSERVICES_API_AUDIT.md`)
   - Documented all 47 current API endpoints
   - Mapped dependencies and service allocation
   - Identified cross-service communication patterns

2. **🗄️ Database Schema Mapping** (`MICROSERVICES_DATABASE_MAPPING.md`)
   - Mapped 30+ database tables to service domains
   - Defined data ownership and access patterns
   - Planned cross-service data communication

3. **🎯 Shared Types Library** (`packages/shared-types/`)
   - Comprehensive TypeScript types for all services
   - API contracts and database schemas
   - Service configuration types

4. **🔗 API Contracts & Service Boundaries** (`MICROSERVICES_API_CONTRACTS.md`)
   - Detailed API specifications for each service
   - Authentication and security protocols
   - Cross-service communication standards

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Service Architecture Implementation

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### **Service Extraction Order** (Minimize Dependencies)

1. **🥇 Content Service** (Week 1-2)
   - **Rationale**: Least coupled, highest development velocity
   - **Scope**: Article generation, CMS integration, OpenAI
   - **Dependencies**: Platform API (user validation only)

2. **🥈 Technical SEO Service** (Week 3-4)  
   - **Rationale**: Well-bounded domain, complex but isolated
   - **Scope**: GSC integration, audits, technical monitoring
   - **Dependencies**: Platform API (user validation only)

3. **🥉 Chat Service** (Week 5-6)
   - **Rationale**: Specialized AI functionality
   - **Scope**: AI conversations, thread management
   - **Dependencies**: Platform, Content, Technical SEO (read-only)

4. **🏆 Platform API Service** (Week 7-8)
   - **Rationale**: Core dependency for all other services
   - **Scope**: User management, billing, website management
   - **Dependencies**: None (foundational service)

## 🚀 Parallel Development Strategy

### **Team Allocation**
```
Team A (Platform + Frontend): 
├── Platform API Service
├── Frontend refactoring
└── Service authentication

Team B (Technical SEO):
├── GSC integration  
├── SEO audit system
└── Technical monitoring

Team C (Content + Chat):
├── Article generation

└── AI chat system
```

### **Parallel Development Benefits**
- **3x Development Velocity**: Teams work independently
- **Independent Deployments**: Ship features without waiting
- **Specialized Expertise**: Teams become domain experts
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Separate codebases eliminate merge conflicts

## 🔧 Development Tools & Infrastructure

- **Framework**: Express.js with middleware
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
- **Authentication**: JWT with service tokens
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- **Testing**: Jest with supertest
- **Monitoring**: Health checks + metrics endpoints

### **Local Development Environment**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for local development
services:
  platform-api:
    build: ./services/platform-api
    ports: ["3001:3001"]
    environment: { NODE_ENV: development }
    
  content-api:
    build: ./services/content-api  
    ports: ["3002:3002"]
    depends_on: [platform-api]
    
  technical-seo-api:
    build: ./services/technical-seo-api
    ports: ["3003:3003"] 
    depends_on: [platform-api]
    
  chat-api:
    build: ./services/chat-api
    ports: ["3004:3004"]
    depends_on: [platform-api, content-api, technical-seo-api]
    
  frontend:
    build: ./apps/frontend
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    depends_on: [platform-api, content-api, technical-seo-api, chat-api]
```

## 🎯 Next Steps to Begin Implementation

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
1. **Setup Repository Structure**: Create services directories
2. **Install Shared Types**: Build and publish types package
3. **Create Content Service**: Start with article generation extraction
4. **Setup Development Environment**: Docker compose for local dev

### **Team Coordination**
- **Daily Standups**: Cross-team service integration updates
- **Weekly Architecture Reviews**: Ensure service boundaries remain clean
- **Sprint Planning**: Coordinate interdependent features
- **Documentation**: Keep API contracts updated as services evolve

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Database Migration**: Test schema changes in staging first
- **Service Communication**: Implement circuit breakers and retries
- **Data Consistency**: Use eventual consistency patterns where appropriate
- **Performance**: Monitor cross-service latency and optimize

## 🏁 Expected Outcomes

After completing this microservices transformation:

✅ **3x Parallel Development** - Teams working independently on different services  
✅ **Independent Deployments** - Ship features without coordinating with other teams  
✅ **Service Specialization** - Teams become experts in their domain (SEO, Content, Platform)  
✅ **Fault Isolation** - Service failures don't cascade to other components  
✅ **Technology Flexibility** - Use different frameworks/tools per service if needed  
✅ **Clear Ownership** - Eliminate confusion about who owns what code  
✅ **Multiple Claude Code Instances** - Run 2-3 Claude instances on different services simultaneously  

This roadmap provides the complete blueprint for transforming SEOAgent into a high-velocity, maintainable microservices architecture that will dramatically increase your development and shipping speed.
