## 1. Common Setup Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- **Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve 'some-module'`
- **Error**: `Error: Cannot find module 'dotenv'`
- **Error**: `npm install failed`

### Root Cause Analysis
- Missing dependencies in `package.json`.
- Incorrect Node.js version.
- Environment variables not set up correctly.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Node.js Version**:
   - Ensure you are using the correct version specified in your project. You can check your version with:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - If necessary, use a version manager like `nvm` to switch versions.

2. **Install Missing Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to install all dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define necessary variables:
     ```
     SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
     ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Use a `.nvmrc` file to specify the Node.js version for the project.
- Regularly update your `package.json` and lock file to ensure all dependencies are up to date.

## 2. Build Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- **Error**: `Error: Cannot find module 'next'`
- **Error**: `Failed to compile.`
- **Error**: `Unexpected token` in JavaScript files.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Syntax errors in JavaScript or TypeScript files.
- Missing or incompatible dependencies.
- Incorrect configuration in `next.config.js`.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check for Syntax Errors**:
   - Review the files mentioned in the error messages for any syntax issues. Use a linter or formatter to help identify problems.

2. **Verify Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed and compatible. You can check for outdated packages using:
     ```bash
     npm outdated
     ```

3. **Review Configuration**:
   - Check `next.config.js` for any misconfigurations. Ensure that any custom Webpack configurations are correctly set.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use TypeScript for type safety and to catch errors at compile time.
- Implement continuous integration (CI) to catch build errors early.

## 3. Runtime Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- **Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined`
- **Error**: `Unhandled Promise Rejection`
- **Error**: Application crashes on specific routes.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Issues with state management or props in React components.
- Unhandled asynchronous operations.
- Incorrect API responses or data structures.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Debugging**:
   - Use `console.log` statements to trace the flow of data and identify where the error occurs.
   - Utilize React Developer Tools to inspect component states and props.

2. **Handle Promises**:
   - Ensure all asynchronous calls are properly handled with `try/catch` blocks or `.catch()` methods.

3. **Check API Responses**:
   - Validate the structure of data returned from APIs. Adjust your code to handle unexpected formats.

### Prevention Strategies
- Implement error boundaries in React to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- Write unit tests to cover critical components and functions.

## 4. Performance Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- **Symptoms**: Slow loading times, high memory usage.
- **Error**: `Warning: Too many re-renders.`
- **Error**: `Warning: A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled.`

### Root Cause Analysis
- Inefficient rendering due to unnecessary re-renders.
- Large bundle sizes or unoptimized assets.
- Memory leaks from improperly managed state or event listeners.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Optimize Rendering**:
   - Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
   - Implement `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks for functions and values that do not change frequently.

2. **Analyze Bundle Size**:
   - Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies and optimize them.

3. **Check for Memory Leaks**:
   - Ensure that event listeners and subscriptions are properly cleaned up in `useEffect` hooks.

### Prevention Strategies
- Regularly profile your application using Chrome DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Use lazy loading for components and images to improve initial load times.

## 5. Database Connectivity

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- **Error**: `Error: Connection refused`
- **Error**: `Query failed: ...`
- **Symptoms**: Slow database queries.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect database connection settings.
- Network issues or database server downtime.
- Inefficient queries or missing indexes.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Verify Connection Settings**:
   - Check your database connection string in the environment variables. Ensure it is correctly formatted.

2. **Test Database Connectivity**:
   - Use a database client (like Postman or DBeaver) to test the connection with the same credentials.

3. **Optimize Queries**:
   - Analyze slow queries using the database's query analysis tools. Add indexes where necessary.

### Prevention Strategies
- Implement connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Regularly review and optimize database schema and queries.

## 6. API Integration

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- **Error**: `Error: Request failed with status code 404`
- **Error**: `Error: Network Error`
- **Symptoms**: Delays in API responses.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect API endpoints or parameters.
- Network issues or CORS policy restrictions.
- Rate limiting by the API provider.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check API Endpoints**:
   - Verify that the API endpoints are correct and accessible. Test them using tools like Postman.

2. **Handle CORS Issues**:
   - Ensure that the server allows requests from your frontend domain. Configure CORS settings in your Express app:
     ```javascript
     const cors = require('cors');
     app.use(cors());
     ```

3. **Implement Retry Logic**:
   - For rate-limited APIs, implement exponential backoff retry logic for failed requests.

### Prevention Strategies
- Maintain documentation for API endpoints and expected responses.
- Monitor API usage to stay within rate limits.

## 7. Deployment Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- **Error**: `Error: Cannot find module 'next'`
- **Error**: `Build failed with errors`
- **Symptoms**: Application not accessible after deployment.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Missing environment variables in the production environment.
- Incorrect build configurations.
- Issues with server setup or permissions.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all necessary environment variables are set in the production environment.

2. **Check Build Configuration**:
   - Review your deployment scripts and configurations. Ensure that the build command is correctly specified:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

3. **Inspect Server Logs**:
   - Check server logs for any errors during the deployment process. This can provide insight into what went wrong.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process and catch errors early.
- Regularly test the deployment process in a staging environment before going live.
