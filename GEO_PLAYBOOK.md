# Answer Engine Optimization (AEO/GEO) Playbook for LLMs

**Source:** Used by 10M+ clients - proven strategies for optimizing content for AI/LLM discovery and citation.

## 1. Identify Prompts

Build a list of 20–50 prompts your target customers might ask:

### A. Ask ChatGPT to Generate Suggestions
- Ask AI for considerations before recommending your service/product
- Example: "What considerations are you taking into account when recommending the best dog food brand?"
- AI response: quality, price, sustainability, shipment speed, etc.
- Turn these into prompts: "Which dog food brand makes the most quality food?" "Which dog food brand has the fastest shipping time?"

### B. Use a Reasoning Model
- Ask multiple AI tools what they know about your brand
- Look at what AI checks (keywords they add) when "thinking"
- See what keywords ChatGPT inserts when searching for answers about your brand
- Optimize for these keywords and turn them into questions

### C. Use Perplexity Auto-Complete
- Insert your main keyword into Perplexity
- Look at its auto-complete function for inspiration

### D. Use Specialized Tools
- Use prompt tracking tools where you can insert your website URL
- Get suggested prompts from these tools

## 2. Answer Those Prompts

Answer customers' questions (prompts) in as many places as possible:

### Content Distribution Strategy
- Don't just write blog posts
- Create relevant content on: Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, local forums, listicles

### Content Freshness & Format
- **AI loves "freshness"** - constantly refresh content, use dates
- Fresh content gets indexed in 48 hours in major AI tools
- **32.5% of all AI citations come from comparative listicles**
- Topics like "best budget laptops in 2025" perform better than how-to or expert content

### Content Optimization for AI Citation
- Include original stats, comparisons, quotes, and bullet points
- **Make content easy to cite, not just easy to read**
- Current AI algorithms are basic (like Google 20 years ago)
- High-volume content on various websites still gets picked up by AI

## 3. Fix Your Technical Setup

### Search Engine Integration
- Submit site to **Bing Webmaster Tool** (ChatGPT uses Bing heavily)
- Update robots.txt to allow: GPTbot, Bingbot, and Googlebot
- Ensure site is fast, crawlable, and well-structured

### Critical Technical Considerations
- **AI bots don't run JavaScript**
- Dynamic components, API-loaded content, text in modals/tabs are invisible
- **If it's not in raw HTML source code, bots can't see it**
- Use server-side rendering or static site generation
- Ensure bots can access all important content

## 4. Schema Markup

### Priority Schema Types
- **FAQ schema** - heavily used by Google's AI Overviews
- **HowTo schema** - structured content for AI consumption
- **Article schema** - adds structured layer for AI parsing

### Meta Description Optimization
- Don't write: "In this blog post you'll learn…"
- **Write to answer customer questions directly**
- Example: "The best dog food is XYZ, and here's why: ABC."

## 5. Create Content on Reddit

### Why Reddit Matters
- **Most cited domain** according to AI prompt trackers
- AI loves unfiltered, user-generated content (UGC)

### Reddit Strategy
- Find relevant threads via Google: `site:reddit.com [topic]`
- Leave high-quality top comments
- Use tools like **f5bot** to monitor keywords and reply first
- Build presence in relevant subreddits
