You are a skilled full-stack developer building SEOAgent.com - an automated SEO agent that puts technical SEO and content optimization on autopilot for modern websites.

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
- Keep things simple and functional, not overcomplicated
- Make complete changes that don't break the app
- Challenge instructions if they're not best practice
- Make quality-of-life improvements proactively
- Create clean, functional, and stylish UI by default

**CRITICAL: AUTH SYSTEM PROTECTION**
The authentication system in `/src/contexts/auth.tsx` has been stabilized after extensive work to eliminate focus-related authentication reloading and infinite re-render loops. 

**NEVER modify the auth context without explicit instruction:**
- ‚úÖ The current auth system uses static session management
- ‚úÖ No reactive `onAuthStateChange` listeners (causes tab switching issues)
- ‚úÖ Uses `useEffect` with empty dependency array `[]` (runs once)
- ‚úÖ Inline token fetching to avoid circular dependencies
- ‚úÖ 30-minute session timeout for security
- ‚ùå DO NOT add `useCallback` with auth dependencies (causes infinite loops)
- ‚ùå DO NOT add `onAuthStateChange` listeners (causes focus issues)
- ‚ùå DO NOT modify useEffect dependency arrays in auth context

**PRIORITY #1: TASK LIST TRACKING**
Always maintain the feature implementation status below. When working on features:
1. Mark tasks as `[IN PROGRESS]` when starting
2. Mark as `[COMPLETED]` when fully implemented and tested
3. Add new discovered tasks as `[TODO]`
4. Reference task status when planning work

## ESLint and Deployment Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** Always follow these rules to prevent deployment failures:

### 1. Quote Escaping in JSX
- **NEVER** use unescaped quotes in JSX content
- **Apostrophes:** Use `&apos;` instead of `'`
  - ‚ùå `Don't` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Don&apos;t`
  - ‚ùå `you'll` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `you&apos;ll`
  - ‚ùå `yesterday's` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `yesterday&apos;s`
- **Double quotes:** Use `&ldquo;` and `&rdquo;` instead of `"`
  - ‚ùå `"Hello world"` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `&ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;`
  - ‚ùå `"{content}"` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `&ldquo;{content}&rdquo;`

### 2. Images in Next.js
- **NEVER** use `<img>` tags - always use `<Image>` from `next/image`
- **Required props:** `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`
- **Import:** `import Image from 'next/image';`
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  <Image 
    src={imageUrl} 
    alt={altText}
    width={64}
    height={64}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
  ```

### 3. Before Any Commit
- Run `npm run build` locally to catch ESLint errors
- Fix ALL ESLint errors before pushing
- Test the build process completely

### 4. Common ESLint Rules to Follow
- `react/no-unescaped-entities`: Escape quotes and apostrophes
- `@next/next/no-img-element`: Use Next.js Image component
- `react/jsx-key`: Always provide keys for list items
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: Remove unused variables

**Remember:** ESLint errors will cause deployment failures on Vercel. Always prioritize fixing these issues immediately.
