## Common Setup Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors during `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Missing environment variables
- Unable to start the development server

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect Node.js version
- Missing dependencies or incorrect versions
- Misconfigured environment variables

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure you are using the correct version of Node.js as specified in the project documentation.
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   If necessary, switch versions using a version manager like `nvm`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables. Refer to the `.env.example` file for guidance.

4. **Start the Development Server**: Use the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Maintain a `.nvmrc` file to specify the Node.js version.
- Document required environment variables clearly in the README file.
- Regularly update dependencies and test the setup process.

## Build Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors during the build process
- Warnings about missing modules
- "Module not found" errors

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect import paths
- Missing dependencies
- Misconfigured Webpack or Babel settings

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Import Paths**: Verify that all import statements use the correct relative paths.
   ```javascript
   import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent'; // Ensure the path is correct
   ```

2. **Install Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter a "Module not found" error, install the missing package:
   ```bash
   npm install <missing-package>
   ```

3. **Review Build Configuration**: Check `next.config.js` and `.babelrc` for any misconfigurations.

4. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, clearing the cache can resolve build issues:
   ```bash
   npm run clean
   ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Use TypeScript for type safety to catch errors early.
- Regularly run builds in a CI/CD pipeline to catch issues before deployment.

## Runtime Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Application crashes with stack traces
- Uncaught exceptions in the console
- Blank pages or infinite loading

### Root Cause Analysis
- Unhandled exceptions in the code
- Issues with state management or asynchronous calls
- Incorrect API responses

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Console Logs**: Inspect the browser console for error messages and stack traces.

2. **Debug the Code**: Use breakpoints or `console.log` statements to identify the source of the error.

3. **Handle Exceptions**: Ensure that all asynchronous calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks.
   ```javascript
   try {
       const response = await fetch('/api/data');
   } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
   }
   ```

4. **Review State Management**: Ensure that state updates are handled correctly, especially in React components.

### Prevention Strategies
- Implement error boundaries in React components to catch rendering errors.
- Write unit tests for critical components and functions.

## Performance Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Slow loading times
- High memory usage
- Unresponsive UI

### Root Cause Analysis
- Large bundle sizes
- Inefficient rendering or state updates
- Unoptimized images or assets

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Analyze Bundle Size**: Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify large dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm run analyze
   ```

2. **Optimize Images**: Use image optimization techniques or libraries like `next/image` for automatic optimization.

3. **Implement Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports to load components only when needed.
   ```javascript
   const MyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./MyComponent'));
   ```

4. **Profile React Components**: Use React's built-in Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.

### Prevention Strategies
- Regularly audit dependencies for size and performance.
- Follow best practices for React performance optimization.

## Database Connectivity

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Connection timeout errors
- Query failures
- Data not being saved or retrieved

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect database configuration
- Network issues
- Insufficient permissions

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Database Configuration**: Verify the database connection string in your environment variables.
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname
   ```

2. **Test Connection**: Use a database client to test the connection using the same credentials.

3. **Review Query Logic**: Ensure that your queries are correctly structured and that the necessary tables exist.

4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that the database user has the required permissions to perform the operations.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Implement logging for database queries to monitor performance and errors.

---

## API Integration

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- API call failures
- Unexpected responses
- Rate limiting errors

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect API endpoints
- Authentication issues
- Rate limits exceeded

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Verify API Endpoints**: Ensure that the API endpoints are correct and accessible.
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
   ```

2. **Check API Keys**: Ensure that the correct API keys are being used and are valid.

3. **Handle Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed requests due to rate limits.

4. **Inspect API Responses**: Log the responses to understand the structure and any errors returned by the API.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use environment variables to manage API keys securely.
- Write integration tests to validate API interactions.

---

## Deployment Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Application not starting in production
- Environment variable issues
- 404 errors for static assets

### Root Cause Analysis
- Misconfigured production environment
- Missing build artifacts
- Incorrect routing or asset paths

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Deployment Logs**: Review logs from your hosting provider for error messages.

2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure that all required environment variables are set in the production environment.

3. **Build the Application**: Ensure that the application is built before deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Check Static Asset Paths**: Ensure that static assets are correctly referenced in the application.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process.
- Regularly test the production build locally before deploying.
