## Common Setup Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors during `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Missing environment variables.
- Application fails to start with `Error: Cannot find module`.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect Node.js version.
- Missing or misconfigured `.env` file.
- Incomplete or corrupted package installations.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Node.js Version**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   Ensure you are using a compatible version (e.g., Node.js 14.x or 16.x).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   Ensure that your `.env` file is present and correctly configured. Example:
   ```plaintext
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

4. **Clear Cache**:
   If issues persist, clear the npm cache:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Use a version manager like `nvm` to maintain the correct Node.js version.
- Document required environment variables in a `README.md` file.

## Build Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors during the build process such as `Module not found` or `Unexpected token`.
- Warnings about deprecated packages.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect import paths.
- Syntax errors in JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- Missing or outdated dependencies.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Import Paths**:
   Review your import statements for typos or incorrect paths. Example:
   ```javascript
   import Component from './components/Component'; // Ensure path is correct
   ```

2. **Fix Syntax Errors**:
   Review the error message for line numbers and correct any syntax errors in your code.

3. **Update Dependencies**:
   Ensure all dependencies are up to date:
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   npm update
   ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Use TypeScript to catch errors at compile-time.
- Regularly run `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

---

## Runtime Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Application crashes with messages like `TypeError: Cannot read property '...' of undefined`.
- Unhandled promise rejections.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Accessing properties of `undefined` or `null`.
- Asynchronous code not handled properly.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Debugging**:
   Use `console.log` to check values before accessing properties:
   ```javascript
   console.log(variable);
   if (variable) {
       console.log(variable.property);
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling**:
   Ensure proper error handling in asynchronous code:
   ```javascript
   async function fetchData() {
       try {
           const response = await apiCall();
           // Process response
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
       }
   }
   ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Implement error boundaries in React components.

## Performance Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Slow loading times.
- High memory usage in the browser.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Large bundle sizes.
- Inefficient rendering or data fetching.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Analyze Bundle Size**:
   Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
   ```

2. **Optimize Images**:
   Use optimized images and consider lazy loading:
   ```javascript
   <img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="description" />
   ```

3. **Code Splitting**:
   Implement dynamic imports for components:
   ```javascript
   const Component = dynamic(() => import('./Component'));
   ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Regularly audit performance using Chrome DevTools.
- Keep dependencies updated and remove unused packages.

---

## Database Connectivity

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors like `ECONNREFUSED` or `Query failed`.
- Timeouts during database operations.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect database connection configuration.
- Network issues or database server downtime.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Connection String**:
   Ensure your database connection string is correct in the `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
   ```

2. **Test Database Connection**:
   Use a database client to verify connectivity.

3. **Review Query Syntax**:
   Check for syntax errors in your SQL queries.

### Prevention Strategies
- Implement connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Monitor database performance and set up alerts for downtime.

---

## API Integration

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors like `404 Not Found` or `500 Internal Server Error`.
- Unexpected API responses.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect API endpoints or parameters.
- Rate limiting by the API provider.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Verify API Endpoints**:
   Check that the API endpoints are correct and accessible:
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
   ```

2. **Handle API Errors**:
   Implement error handling for API calls:
   ```javascript
   if (!response.ok) {
       throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
   }
   ```

3. **Check API Documentation**:
   Ensure you are following the API's guidelines for requests and responses.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use environment variables for API keys and secrets.
- Implement retry logic for failed requests.

---

## Deployment Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Deployment fails with messages like `Build failed` or `Server error`.
- Application does not start in production.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Environment variables not set in production.
- Build configuration issues.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   Ensure all required environment variables are set in the production environment.

2. **Review Build Configuration**:
   Check your `next.config.js` for any misconfigurations.

3. **Logs**:
   Review server logs for detailed error messages.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments and catch errors early.
- Document deployment steps and environment configurations.
