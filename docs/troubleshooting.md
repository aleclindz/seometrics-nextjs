## 1. Common Setup Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors during `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Missing environment variables.
- Incorrect package versions.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incompatible package versions or missing dependencies.
- Environment variables not set in `.env` file.
- Node.js version mismatch.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Node.js Version**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   Ensure you are using the recommended version (check `package.json` for `engines`).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
   Ensure there are no errors during installation.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add required variables as specified in the project documentation.

### Prevention Strategies
- Regularly update dependencies and check compatibility.
- Use a version manager like `nvm` to manage Node.js versions.
- Document environment variable requirements clearly.

## 2. Build Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Errors during `npm run build` or `next build`.
- Syntax errors in JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- Module not found errors.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect import paths or missing files.
- Syntax issues in code (e.g., missing semicolons, mismatched brackets).
- Unsupported features in the current JavaScript version.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check for Syntax Errors**:
   - Use a linter like ESLint to identify issues:
   ```bash
   npx eslint .
   ```

2. **Verify Import Paths**:
   - Ensure all import statements are correct and files exist.

3. **Update Next.js Configuration**:
   - Check `next.config.js` for any misconfigurations.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use TypeScript to catch type-related issues during development.
- Set up continuous integration (CI) to catch build errors early.

## 3. Runtime Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Application crashes with error messages in the console.
- Unhandled promise rejections.
- "Cannot read property of undefined" errors.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Logic errors in the code.
- Asynchronous code not handled properly.
- State management issues in React components.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - Look for stack traces in the browser console to identify the source of the error.

2. **Use Error Boundaries**:
   - Implement error boundaries in React to catch errors in components:
   ```javascript
   class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = { hasError: false };
     }

     static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
       return { hasError: true };
     }

     componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
       console.error("Error caught in Error Boundary:", error, errorInfo);
     }

     render() {
       if (this.state.hasError) {
         return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
       }
       return this.props.children; 
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Handle Promises Properly**:
   - Ensure all promises are handled with `.catch()` or use `async/await` with try/catch.

### Prevention Strategies
- Write unit tests to cover critical functionality.
- Use TypeScript to catch potential runtime errors during development.

## 4. Performance Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Slow loading times.
- High memory usage in the browser.
- Laggy UI interactions.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Large bundle sizes due to unoptimized assets.
- Inefficient rendering in React components.
- Excessive API calls or data fetching.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Analyze Bundle Size**:
   - Use Webpack Bundle Analyzer:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
   ```
   Add to your build script and analyze the output.

2. **Optimize React Components**:
   - Use `React.memo` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

3. **Implement Lazy Loading**:
   - Use dynamic imports for components that are not immediately needed:
   ```javascript
   const LazyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
   ```

### Prevention Strategies
- Regularly audit performance using tools like Lighthouse.
- Optimize images and assets before adding them to the project.

## 5. Database Connectivity

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Connection timeout errors.
- Query execution failures.
- Data not being saved or retrieved correctly.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect database connection string.
- Network issues or database server downtime.
- Misconfigured database permissions.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Verify Connection String**:
   - Check the connection string in your `.env` file for accuracy.

2. **Test Database Connection**:
   - Use a database client to manually connect and test queries.

3. **Check Database Logs**:
   - Review logs for any errors or warnings related to connectivity.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Monitor database performance and set up alerts for downtime.

## 6. API Integration

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- API requests failing with 4xx or 5xx status codes.
- Unexpected data format in API responses.
- CORS errors in the browser.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect API endpoint or request parameters.
- API rate limits being exceeded.
- CORS policy not set up correctly on the server.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check API Endpoints**:
   - Verify that the API endpoints are correct and accessible.

2. **Inspect Network Requests**:
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses.

3. **Handle CORS Issues**:
   - Ensure the server is configured to allow requests from your frontend domain.

### Prevention Strategies
- Implement error handling for API requests to manage failures gracefully.
- Document API usage and expected responses clearly.

---

## 7. Deployment Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Application not starting in production.
- Environment variables not being recognized.
- 404 errors for static assets.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Misconfigured deployment settings.
- Missing or incorrect environment variables.
- Build artifacts not being served correctly.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. **Check Deployment Logs**:
   - Review logs from your hosting provider for errors during deployment.

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in the production environment.

3. **Inspect Static File Serving**:
   - Ensure that static files are being served correctly by your server configuration.

### Prevention Strategies
- Automate deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines.
- Maintain a checklist for deployment to ensure all steps are followed.
