# Database Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the database architecture, schema, query patterns, data models, and performance considerations for the project utilizing Supabase as the database solution.

## 1. Database Architecture

### Type
The project uses **Supabase**, an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage.

### Hosting
Supabase is hosted on the Supabase cloud infrastructure, which offers scalability and reliability. The database is managed by Supabase, ensuring automatic backups and updates.

### Connection Details
To connect to the Supabase database, the following details are required:
- **URL**: The Supabase project URL, typically in the format `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co`
- **API Key**: A secret API key that grants access to the database.
- **Database URL**: The PostgreSQL connection string, which includes the database name, user, password, and host.

### Dependencies
The project relies on the following npm packages:
- `@supabase/ssr`: For server-side rendering with Supabase.
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: The official JavaScript client library for interacting with Supabase.

## 2. Schema Overview

The database schema consists of multiple tables that represent different entities in the application. Below is a high-level overview of the tables and their relationships.

### Tables
- **Users**: Stores user information and authentication details.
- **Posts**: Contains blog posts or articles created by users.
- **Comments**: Stores comments made by users on posts.
- **Categories**: Represents categories for organizing posts.
- **Tags**: Allows tagging of posts for better searchability.

### Relationships
- **Users to Posts**: One-to-Many (A user can create multiple posts).
- **Posts to Comments**: One-to-Many (A post can have multiple comments).
- **Posts to Categories**: Many-to-One (A post belongs to one category).
- **Posts to Tags**: Many-to-Many (A post can have multiple tags, and a tag can belong to multiple posts).

## 3. Query Patterns

The database is accessed and modified through various query patterns, primarily using the Supabase client library. Below are examples of common query patterns:

### Data Retrieval
- **Fetching All Posts**:
  ```javascript
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select('*');
  ```

- **Fetching Posts by Category**:
  ```javascript
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select('*')
    .eq('category_id', categoryId);
  ```

### Data Insertion
- **Inserting a New Post**:
  ```javascript
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .insert([
      { title: 'New Post', content: 'Post content', user_id: userId, category_id: categoryId }
    ]);
  ```

### Data Update
- **Updating a Post**:
  ```javascript
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .update({ title: 'Updated Title' })
    .eq('id', postId);
  ```

### Data Deletion
- **Deleting a Comment**:
  ```javascript
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('comments')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', commentId);
  ```

## 4. Data Models

### Users Table
- **id**: UUID (Primary Key)
- **email**: String (Unique, Required)
- **password**: String (Required)
- **created_at**: Timestamp (Default: now())

### Posts Table
- **id**: UUID (Primary Key)
- **title**: String (Required)
- **content**: Text (Required)
- **user_id**: UUID (Foreign Key referencing Users)
- **category_id**: UUID (Foreign Key referencing Categories)
- **created_at**: Timestamp (Default: now())

### Comments Table
- **id**: UUID (Primary Key)
- **post_id**: UUID (Foreign Key referencing Posts)
- **user_id**: UUID (Foreign Key referencing Users)
- **content**: Text (Required)
- **created_at**: Timestamp (Default: now())

### Categories Table
- **id**: UUID (Primary Key)
- **name**: String (Unique, Required)

### Tags Table
- **id**: UUID (Primary Key)
- **name**: String (Unique, Required)

### PostTags Table (Join Table for Many-to-Many Relationship)
- **post_id**: UUID (Foreign Key referencing Posts)
- **tag_id**: UUID (Foreign Key referencing Tags)

## 5. Performance Considerations

### Indexing
To optimize query performance, the following indexes should be considered:
- Index on `user_id` in the Posts table to speed up queries filtering by user.
- Index on `category_id` in the Posts table to enhance performance for category-based queries.
- Composite index on `post_id` and `user_id` in the Comments table for efficient retrieval of comments.

### Optimization
- **Batch Inserts**: Use batch inserts for adding multiple records at once to reduce the number of transactions.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination in queries that return large datasets to improve load times and user experience.
- **Caching**: Utilize caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

This documentation serves as a guide for developers to understand and work with the Supabase database in this project effectively. It is recommended to keep this documentation updated as the database schema evolves.
