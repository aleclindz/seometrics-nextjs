## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure you have the following tools and accounts:

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or later. You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js. Verify installation with:
  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```
- **Git**: For version control. Download from [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Vercel Account**: Sign up at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) if deploying on Vercel.
- **Supabase Account**: Create an account at [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) for database management.

## Environment Setup

Set up the required environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of your project. Below is an example configuration:

```dotenv
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret_key>

# Google APIs Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>

# Other Environment Variables
NODE_ENV=production
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

## Build Process

To build the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the application for production, optimizing the code and assets.

## Deployment Steps

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy the Application**:
   Run the following command in the root directory of your project:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts** to configure your deployment. Vercel will automatically detect your project settings.

5. **Set Environment Variables**:
   After deployment, set the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel.
   - Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section.
   - Add the necessary variables as defined in your `.env` file.

### Generic Node.js Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it as described in the Environment Setup section.

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   If applicable, run the database migration script:
   ```bash
   npm run run-migration
   ```

5. **Start the Application**:
   Use the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Configure Reverse Proxy** (if necessary):
   If deploying behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx), ensure to configure it to forward requests to the Node.js server.

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, verify that the application is running correctly:

1. **Check Application Status**:
   - For Vercel, visit the provided URL after deployment.
   - For Node.js, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or the configured port.

2. **Monitor Logs**:
   - For Vercel, check the logs in the Vercel dashboard.
   - For Node.js, monitor logs in the terminal or set up a logging service.

3. **Test Functionality**:
   Ensure all features are working as expected, including database connections and third-party integrations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

1. **Environment Variables Not Set**:
   Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file or the deployment platform's environment settings.

2. **Database Connection Errors**:
   Verify that the Supabase URL and keys are correct. Check network configurations if applicable.

3. **Build Failures**:
   - Check the build logs for errors.
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible.

4. **Application Not Starting**:
   - Verify that the correct Node.js version is being used.
   - Check for any syntax errors or missing modules.

5. **API Errors**:
   If you encounter API errors, review the API keys and permissions in your third-party services (e.g., Stripe, Google APIs).

By following this guide, you should be able to successfully deploy the application on both Vercel and a generic Node.js environment. For further assistance, refer to the documentation of the respective platforms or reach out to the development team.
